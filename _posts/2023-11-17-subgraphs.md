## Context and background:

As the first technical writer at [Advanced Blockchain](https://www.advancedblockchain.com/), an incubator for blockchain projects, I arrived to a significant lack of technical documentation. In a dynamic, fast-paced setting developers were forging ahead with novel DeFi projects, but the documentation gaps presented critical bottlenecks. This resulted in challenges for testing code, maintenance, and onboarding.

I assessed existing documentation, aligning it with the company goals to develop a scope and strategy for technical documentation.

The writing sample below is an excerpt of a tutorial on Subgraphs based on a couple of meetings I had with developers on the subject.

# Subgraphs simplified: A practical tutorial

## Introduction

Welcome to our tutorial on harnessing the power of Subgraphs for insightful blockchain data analysis and manipulation. Throughout this guide, we'll walk through the process of efficiently using subgraphs and explore their diverse applications.

## Understanding subgraphs

Subgraphs offer swift access to historical blockchain data with minimal delays. They serve as off-chain data storage solutions, equipped with a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API, imposing virtually no limits on data processing and manipulation. Their ease of use and effectiveness make them a valuable tool for developers.

## When to use subgraphs

Subgraphs are ideal for the following scenarios:

- **Supported Blockchains:** Ensure the blockchain you're working with is supported, noting that some chains might not be compatible.
- **Handling Extensive Historical Data:** Ideal for managing large volumes of historical data on a regular basis.
- **Delay in Block Listing:** When it's acceptable to have a brief delay in listing new blocks is acceptable, as subgraphs take time to catch up.
- **Single-Chain:** Not suitable for aggregating data from various sources; deploying on multiple chains simultaneously is not yet supported.

Subgraphs are custom-built open APIs designed to efficiently organize blockchain data for easy searching, retrieval, and querying. This enables applications to access specific data without the need to sift through the entire blockchain.

As open APIs, developers can integrate subgraphs into their decentralized applications (dApps).

## Implementing subgraphs: A step-by-step approach

### 1. Creating subgraphs

To create a subgraph, you have two approaches:

1. Using a Template: Utilize a pre-existing template for deployment, configure it to your needs, and let the system deploy it automatically.

2. Starting from Scratch: Begin the creation process from the ground up. Check the prerequisites and install anything needed for the process.

### 3. Configuration

Adjust configurations as needed, including entities and addresses, without traversing the entire chain.

### Implementing subgraphs

You can deploy subgraphs automatically without the need for an online repository. An example of the live playground can be found [here](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/hehe100596/template-subgraph).

### 4. Autogeneration

Leverage the autogeneration capabilities to speed up the process. It saves you time by creating the required classes and background scripts based on JSON and Schema.

### 5. GraphQL API

Think of the GraphQL API as an interface for efficient data retrieval.

## Error handling and troubleshooting

When creating subgraphs, it's important to be prepared for potential errors or issues that might arise during the process. Common problems include incorrect schema definitions, API call failures, or errors in mapping functions. Here are some strategies to handle errors and troubleshoot effectively:

#### Logging and debugging:

- Implement robust logging mechanisms within your subgraph to capture errors and debug information. This will aid in identifying issues during development and deployment.

#### Error messages and stack traces

- Pay attention to error messages and stack traces to pinpoint the root cause of any issues. The error messages often provide valuable insights into what went wrong.

#### Thorough testing

- Conduct thorough testing of your subgraph during development. Simulate various scenarios and edge cases to ensure your subgraph handles different situations gracefully.

## Security considerations

- Ensuring the security of your subgraph is crucial to protect both your data and the users of your application. Here are some security considerations to keep in mind:

#### Data encryption

- Implement encryption mechanisms to secure sensitive data stored in your subgraph. This is especially important for handling personally identifiable information (PII) and other confidential data.

#### Secure API endpoints

- Implement secure access controls and authentication mechanisms for your GraphQL API endpoints to prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse.

#### Data validation and sanitization

- Validate and sanitize user input to prevent potential vulnerabilities such as injection attacks. Ensure that only valid and safe data is processed.

#### Regular security audits

- Conduct regular security audits of your subgraph's code and configurations. Consider engaging security professionals to identify vulnerabilities and recommend improvements.

#### Compliance with regulations

- Ensure that your subgraph complies with relevant data privacy and security regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or others that may apply based on the nature of your application.

## Optimization techniques

Optimizing your subgraph can significantly enhance its performance and efficiency. Here are some techniques to optimize your subgraph:

#### i. Query efficiency

Optimize your GraphQL queries to fetch only the necessary data. Minimize unnecessary querying to reduce indexing time and improve response times.

#### ii. Indexing strategies

Experiment with different indexing strategies to identify the most efficient approach for your subgraph. Consider using indexing rules to filter relevant data.

#### iii. Caching

Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data. This can drastically reduce the response time for repeated queries.

#### iv. Batch processing

Utilize batch processing techniques to handle multiple transactions or events in a single operation. This can optimize resource utilization and improve indexing speed.

## Unit testing and validation

To ensure the reliability and correctness of your subgraph, it's essential to incorporate unit testing into your development process. Here are steps to effectively test and validate your subgraph:

#### Unit test suite

Develop a comprehensive unit test suite covering various aspects of your subgraph, including mapping functions, event handling, and data integrity.

#### Automated testing

Integrate automated testing into your development workflow to run tests automatically whenever changes are made. This ensures that any regressions or issues are detected early.

#### Mock data

Use mock data for testing to simulate different scenarios and edge cases. This allows you to validate the behavior of your subgraph in a controlled environment.

#### Continuous integration (CI)

Utilize CI tools to run your unit tests automatically whenever code is pushed to the repository. This helps maintain code quality and ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.

### 6. Mapping data

Use the mapping process to efficiently transform blockchain event data into structured data entities. Write mappings using AssemblyScript, which compiles to WASM.

## Advanced usage: Beyond the basics

1. **Entity functions**: Familiarize yourself with basic entity functions such as save, load, and remove.

2. **Contract data retrieval**: Learn how to access contract data, including state variables marked as public and accessible view functions.

3. **User data handling**: Create a user ID and populate associated data fields, showcasing the versatility of subgraphs.

## Conclusion

With this tutorial, you are equipped to build effective subgraphs. Armed with this knowledge, you are well on your way to optimizing your blockchain data analysis and manipulation processes. Happy subgraphing!
