## Introduction

From [Form3 API Docs](https://www.api-docs.form3.tech/api/schemes/us-instant/payment-recalls/outbound-recalls/fetch-recall-decision)

Both inbound and outbound recalls are represented in the Form3 API by the Payment Recall resource, which is a child resource of the Payment resource the recall is for. The Recall Submission or Recall Admission resources are children of the Recall resource and indicate if a recall is inbound (Admission) or outbound (Submission).
