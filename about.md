Hello! Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio.
<br><br>
I'm Fiona Roy, an accomnplished technical writer with expertise in Blockchain technologies, Financial Services and Software. I thrive on exploring new tech!

A native English technical communicator, I started my career as an architect and urban designer following post-graduate studies in the UK. Upon relocating to South America, I contributed to large-scale infrastructure projects, including hydroelectric, petroleum, mining and industrial engineering.

Simultanously, I freelanced as a translator and editor converting legal texts, regulatory directives and financial documents from Portuguese and Spanish into English.

Recognizing that software is eating the world, I shifted my focuss to the software space, as I want to be a part of it. Now, every day I relish the challenge of translating cutting-edge technology into clear, accessible language.

Having gained experience with developer documentation in the areas of Blockchain and Cloud Computing, I am now on a path to learn web development, aspiring to broaden my skillset and enhance the value I bring as a documentation specialist and UI writer.

Currently preparing for the AWS Practitioner exam, I'm also learning the foundations of React and Solidity. Additionally, I'm engaged in hands-on learning by creating web applications as part of my self-directed educational journey.

Currently residing in Portugal, I spend my spare time hiking, exploring museums and relaxing in street cafes. But I devote much of my free time to experimenting with HTML and researching blockchain technology.
