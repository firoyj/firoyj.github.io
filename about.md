Hello, thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio!
<br><br>
I'm Fiona Roy, an accomnplished technical writer with expertise in blockchain technologies, financial services and software-as-a-service. I thrive on exploring new tech!

A native English technical communicator, I started my career as an architect and urban designer following post-graduate studies in the UK. Upon relocating to South America, I contributed to large-scale infrastructure projects, such as hydroelectric, petroleum, mining and industrial engineering.

Simultanously, I freelanced as a translator and editor converting legal texts, regulatory directives and financial documents from Portuguese and Spanish into English.

Recognizing the transformative power of software and automation in reshaping industries, I shifted my focuss to the software space. Every day I relish working with cutting-edge technology, embracing the challenge of simplifying complex concepts into clear, accessible language.

Now residing in Portugal, I spend my spare time hiking, exploring museums and relaxing in street cafes. Additionally, I spend a significant portion of my free time experimenting with HTML and researching blockchain projects.
