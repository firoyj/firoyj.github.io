# WELCOME AND BIO

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio. I'm Fiona Roy, an experienced linguist and technical author in the areas of Financial Services, SaaS, and Blockchain technologies. I thrive on exploring new tech frontiers!

As a native English speaker with extensive background in linguistics and technical communication, I initially worked as an architect and urban designer following post-graduate studies in the UK. Subsequently, I contributed to large-scale infrastructure projects in South America, encompassing hydro-electric, petroleum, mining, as well as industrial, mechanical, and electronic engineering.

Simultaneously, I worked in translation in the fields of contract law, regulatory directives, and financial documents.

Recognizing the transformative power of software and automation in reshaping industries, I shifted to focussing my technical and collaborative skills on the software space.

I now live in Portugal, and in my spare time I enjoy nature, museums and street cafes. I also spend far too much of my spare time playing around with html and researching blockchain projects.
