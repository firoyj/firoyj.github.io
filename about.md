Hello! Thank you for taking the time to review my portfolio. 
<br><br>
I'm Fiona Roy, an experienced technical writer in financial services, SaaS, and blockchain technologies. I thrive on exploring new tech!

As a native English linguist with extensive background in technical communication, I initially worked as an architect and urban designer following post-graduate studies in the UK. Subsequently, I moved to Brazil where I contributed to large-scale infrastructure projects, encompassing hydro-electric, petroleum, and mining.

Simultaneously, I translated contract law, regulatory directives, and financial documents from Portuguese and Spanish into English.

Recognizing the transformative power of software and automation in reshaping industries, I shifted to focussing my technical and collaborative skills on the software space.

I now live in Portugal, and in my spare time I enjoy nature, museums and street cafes. I also spend a lot of my spare time playing around with html and researching blockchain projects.
