Thank you for visiting my portfolio!

I'm Fiona Roy, an experienced technical writer specializing in developer documentation within the Cloud, Fintech, and Blockchain sectors.

A native English technical communicator, I started my career as an architect and urban designer. Following post-graduate studies in the UK and several years working on high-profile projects throughout Europe, I relocated to South America. There, I contributed to the documentation of large-scale infrastructure projects, including hydroelectric, petroleum, mining, and industrial engineering. This experience honed my ability to translate complex technical information into clear and accessible language.

Recognizing that software is eating the world, I shifted my focus to this exciting space. I'm passionate about translating cutting-edge technology into clear, accessible language.

Currently preparing for the AWS SysOps Administrator exam, I've also learned some basics of Golang, React, and Solidity to be able to provide better documentation. I've been actively engaged in DevOps processes, documenting such as like Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, and GitHub Actions.

Residing in Coimbra, Portugal, I spend my spare time hiking, exploring museums, and discovering street cafes.
