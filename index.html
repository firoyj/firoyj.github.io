Welcome to my technical documentation portfolio.
<br><br>
Welcome to my portfolio. I’m a Senior Information Architect and Documentation Leader with 17+ years of experience delivering high-impact developer documentation for Cloud, Fintech and Blockchain platforms. I specialize in transforming complex systems into clear, actionable content, with a strong focus on API docs, onboarding, and integration flows.

Beyond writing, I drive end-to-end documentation strategy—defining information architecture, scaling documentation systems, and mentoring teams on best practices. I often work cross-functionally with engineering, product and support to reduce friction and improve customer outcomes.
